# Roadmap-Extraction
The main approach solving the problem of roadmap extraction was to use the package named OSMnx. The original map source was exported from an open-source database named OpenStreetMap. After acquiring the GPS of a latitude-longitude bounding box which consisted of upper and lower latitudes, left and right longitudes, the specific part of construct street networks can be downloaded. After the detailed analysis of the construct street networks, the GPS data of each node and the connectivity matrix between every other node can be outputted based on NetworkX package. Whether a node was connected to another one can be found from the connectivity between these two nodes.
